# Docker Spring Boot Seed

This is a project seed for Spring Boot java applications running inside of a Docker container

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Starting Server

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Navigate to the root directory

```
cd docker-spring-boot
```

Build Docker container from openJDK image

```
docker build -f Dockerfile -t docker-spring-boot .
```

Confirm Docker image creation

```
docker images
```

Run Docker container

```
docker run -p 8085:8085 docker-spring-boot
```

Run Docker container

```
docker run -p 8085:8085 docker-spring-boot
```

### Stopping Server

Find running containers

```
dev\docker-spring-boot-seed\docker-spring-boot>docker ps -s
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES               SIZE

2MB)

```

Stop container by name

```
docker stop hardcore_bardeen

```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
